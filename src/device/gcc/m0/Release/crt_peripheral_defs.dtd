	 example, if a system control register bit is used to determine
	 if the peripheral is powered/clocked, then it is used at this
	 level. Also, see enable for group and register. Note that
	 enableFor is only used for group/reg/field, since a peripheral
	 instance would not be used if not present. The readRegSize
	 forces reads to the exact size of registers; otherwise, they

	<!-- Groups are used to encapsulate related registers which

	     optionally gives a register expression to use to enable
	     or disable. The expression will be register name only
	     (so enabled if not 0, disabled if 0), reg=value, reg!=value,
	     reg&mask, reg&mask=value, and reg&mask!=value. Value is
	     any constant, e.g. "sys_ctrl&0x80" is enabled if bit 7
	     is 1. The enableFor attribute is used to determine if the
	     group exists at all (vs. being disabled) and bases its
	     tests soley on the peripheralInstance name. The peripheral
	     instance must be in the format of name_xxx where name is
	     the instance name, "_" is the separator, and xxx is some
	     number or string to represent version or family or some
	     other use. For example, enableFor=">2" would match PWM_3,
	     since 3 > 2. EnableFor="v2,v3,v4" would match UART0_v3. The
